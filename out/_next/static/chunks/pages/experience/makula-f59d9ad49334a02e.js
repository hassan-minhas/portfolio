This approach ensured efficient handling of large files by splitting them into smaller, manageable parts during the upload process. For displaying these models, I utilized the Threedy library, which provided robust tools for rendering and interacting with 3D models within the application.","Pagination across application lists, significantlym enhancing the scalability of the platform. This feature allowed for the efficient handling of large datasets by loading only a subset of data at a time, which improved the application's performance.","I enhanced map functionality to display tagged location pins within the visible area, ensuring that users could easily see relevant locations as they navigated the map. Additionally, I maintained data integrity during drag-and-drop actions, allowing users to reposition location pins without losing any associated information.","Implemented a paginated Kanban board similar to Jira, which enabled users to manage tasks more effectively. This feature allowed users to handle large numbers of tasks efficiently by loading tasks in pages, rather than all at once. This not only improved the overall workflow efficiency but also provided a smoother and more organized user experience, making task management more intuitive and less cluttered.","Worked on real-time in-app notifications for chat messages and other time-sensitive processes using PubNub. This implementation ensured that users received updates promptly, enhancing overall user engagement.","I optimized data management and processing speed by maintaining a cache with Apollo services. This approach significantly reduced the number of network calls, enhancing the overall performance of the application.","I worked on implementing drag-and-drop functionality for items within a list, allowing users to rearrange items according to their needs. This feature enhanced the user experience by providing a flexible and intuitive way to organize and customize lists, making the application more user-friendly and adaptable to individual preferences."].map(e=>(0,t.jsxs)(p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(s.Z,{color:"inherit",fontSize:"small",sx:{margin:"0 5px 0 0"}}),(0,t.jsx)(c,{children:e})]}))]});n.default=u}},function(e){e.O(0,[774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=7783)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
